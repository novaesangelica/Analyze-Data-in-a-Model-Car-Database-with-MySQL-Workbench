Project Scenario
Mint Classics Company, a retailer of classic model cars and other vehicles, is looking at closing one of their storage facilities.
To support a data-based business decision, they are looking for suggestions and recommendations for reorganizing and reducing inventory, while still maintaining timely service to their customers. For example, they would like to be able to ship a product to a customer within 24 hours of the order being placed.
As a data analyst, you have been asked to use MySQL Workbench to familiarize yourself with the general business by examining the current data. You will be provided with a data model and sample data tables to review. You will then need to isolate and identify those parts of the data that could be useful in deciding how to reduce inventory.
Project plan
This project requires you to independently complete the following steps:
1.	Import the classic model car relational database
2.	Familiarize yourself with the Mint Classic database and business processes
3.	Investigate the business problem and identify tables impacted
4.	Formulate suggestions and recommendations for solving the business problem
